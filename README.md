#Basic calculator Function Using javascript

This is a third week exercise where I learned how to use js. The task was to create a calculator with javascript.

##The criteria was as follows:

* It had to have two types: basic and advanced.

* The basic calculator had to be able to Divide, Subtract, Add or Multiply.

* The advanced function needed to be able to perform Square Root and Power Of calculations.

This project was built with ATOM. The basic prerequisites are either ATOM or a text editor that is capable of running JS and HTML. ATOM can be downloaded by using the following link and then following the instruction on the website: https://atom.io/

In order to test the function, launch it in the explorer window and use the prompts to test all the criteria detailed in the second paragraph. As this program does not have the 'Loop' process, in order to restart to program and choose a different, the page needs to be restarted after each calculation is complete.
